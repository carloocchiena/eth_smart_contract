# eth_smart_contract

A straight-forward smart contract implemented for testing purpose, and fully working on remix.ide allowing to send token to a wallet address.

Since it's the first smart contract I ever created, I took a non-trivial journey scratching at least the surface of how solidity works.

You can see the commented line-by-line code of those researchs in my MISC repo: <a href="https://github.com/carloocchiena/code_chunks/tree/master/solidity" target="_blank">carloocchiena/code_chunks/solidity</a>

Proof of the works done by the smart contract:

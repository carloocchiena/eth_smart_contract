# eth_smart_contract

A straightforward smart contract implementation for testing purpose, and fully working on <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/">Remix.ethereum.org</a> allowing to send token to a wallet address.

Since it's the first smart contract I ever created, I took a non-trivial journey scratching at least the surface of how Solidity works, based on <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/contracts.html">Solidity Documentation</a>.

You can see the commented line-by-line code of those researchs in my MISC repo: <a href="https://github.com/carloocchiena/code_chunks/tree/master/solidity" target="_blank">carloocchiena/code_chunks/solidity</a>.<br> 
There I digged about the logic of time activation of smart contracts and the logic of ownership, but being not needed there, I skipped the implementation in this specific smart contract.

Proof of the works done by the smart contract:

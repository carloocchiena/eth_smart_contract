# eth_smart_contract

Two smart contracts implementation for studying and testing purpose, and fully working on <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/">Remix.ethereum.org</a>.

_smart_contract.sol_ is a strightforward approach with just a token "ping" transaction (+1 ping, +1 token).<br>
_marketplace.sol_ dive into the logics of buyer, seller, price and available funds.

Since those are the first smart contracts I ever created, I took a non-trivial journey scratching at least the surface of how Solidity works, based on <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/contracts.html">Solidity Documentation</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY0xL8V6NzzFcwzHCgB8orQ">YT's DAPP University</a> and  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkm6luGCS3hD25jcEhvRMIA">Microsoft's Reactor (by Meg Lewis!)</a>.

You can see the commented line-by-line code of those researchs in my _misc_ repo Code Chunks: <a href="https://github.com/carloocchiena/code_chunks/tree/master/solidity" target="_blank">carloocchiena/code_chunks/solidity</a>.<br> 

There I digged about the logic of time activation of smart contracts and the logic of ownership.
